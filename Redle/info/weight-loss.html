                        <p>Oats are rich in fiber, so a serving can help you feel full 
                            throughout the day. Just a half cup packs 4.6 grams of Resistant
                            Starch, a healthy carb that boosts metabolism and burns fat.</p>

                        <p>A cup of black beans packs a whopping 15 grams of satisfying protein
                            and doesn't contain any of the saturated fat found in other protein
                            sources, like red meat.</p>

                        <p>There's no reason to be afraid of eating fats—as long as they're the 
                            right fats. Oleic acid, a compound in avocados' healthy monounsaturated
                            fats (MUFAs), may trigger your body to actually quiet hunger. Stick to a 
                            quarter or a half of an avocado and watch that belly fat melt away. The creamy
                            fruit is also packed with fiber and protein.</p><br>

                        <h3 id="link4">Salmon</h3>

                        <p>Lean sources of protein help you feel full without adding fat. However, 50% 
                            of women ages 18 to 50 don't know if they get enough of this essential nutrient.
                            Up your intake with salmon; it's a leaner choice than red meat and is chock-full
                            of MUFAs to boot. A 2001 study found that dieters eating a MUFA-rich diet lost 
                            an average of 9 pounds, while their low-fat diet counterparts gained, on average, 6.</p>

                        <p>Best known for their anti-aging effects, blueberries, while tiny, are a powerful
                            figure-friendly eat: A 1-cup serving sets you back only 80 calories, and helps
                            you feel full with 4 grams of fiber.</p><br>

                        <p>Cooked or raw, this cruciferous veggie is well-known for its cancer-preventing
                            powers, but with a punch of filling fiber in less than 30 calories a serving, 
                            it's bound to prevent weight problems too.</p><br>

                        <p>Brown rice is a heartier, fiber-packed alternative to less-than-super white rice.
                            A half-cup serving contains 1.7 grams ofResistant Starch, a healthy carb that 
                            boosts metabolism and burns fat. Plus, brown rice is a low-energy-density food, 
                            meaning it's heavy and filling but low in calories. One study found that women
                            who ate a higher-energy-density diet gained three times as much weight over six 
                            years than women eating a low-energy-density diet.</p><br>

                        <p>Just one pear packs 15% of your daily recommended amount of fiber. One study found
                            that women who ate three pears a day consumed fewer calories and lost more weight
                            than those who didn't. Ditch the peeler though; the skin is where all that filling
                            fiber is hiding!</p>

                        <p>Resveratrol, the famed antioxidant found in grape skin, stops fat storage. Studies 
                            show that moderate wine drinkers have narrower waists and less belly fat than liquor
                            drinkers. Downing a glass can boost your calorie burn for a good 90 minutes.</p><br>

                        <p>Even if you changed nothing else about your diet, eating half a grapefruit before 
                            each meal may help you lose up to a pound a week! A compound in the tangy fruit can
                            lower insulin, a fat-storage hormone, and that can lead to weight loss. It's also
                            a good source of protein, and because it's at least 90% water, it can fill you up 
                            so you eat less.</p><br>

                        <p>One of several varieties of beans to make the list, red beans offer protein and 
                            fiber (more than 5 grams per serving!). Kidney beans are also rich in Resistant
                            Starch; a 1/2-cup serving packs nearly 2 grams of this slimming carb.</p><br>

                        <p>Nuts are another superfood rich in healthy fats that help you slim down. Almonds in
                            particular can help you shed pounds: In one study, people who added a daily helping
                            of the nuts to a low-cal diet lost more weight than people who followed the same 
                            diet but swapped almonds for a carb-heavy snack like crackers.</p>
