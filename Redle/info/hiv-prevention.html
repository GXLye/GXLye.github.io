                        <p>Within a month or two of HIV entering the body, 40% to 90% of people 
                            experience flulike symptoms known as acute retroviral syndrome (ARS).
                            But sometimes HIV symptoms don't appear for years—sometimes even
                            a decade—after infection.</p>

                        <p>"In the early stages of HIV infection, the most common symptoms are
                            none," says Michael Horberg, MD, director of HIV/AIDS for Kaiser
                            Permanente, in Oakland, Calif. One in five people in the United 
                            States with HIV doesn't know they have it, which is why it's so 
                            important to get tested, especially if you have unprotected sex
                            with more than one partner or use intravenous drugs.</p>

                        <h3 id="link2">Fever</h3>

                        <figure class="sideline1"><img src="images/1/fever.jpg" alt="fever"></figure>

                        <p>
                            One of the first signs of ARS can be a mild fever, up to about 
                                102 degrees F.

                            The fever, if it occurs at all, is often accompanied by other 
                                usually mild symptoms, such as fatigue, swollen lymph glands,
                                and a sore throat.

                           "At this point the virus is moving into the blood stream and 
                                starting to replicate in large numbers," says Carlos Malvestutto,
                                MD, instructor of infectious diseases and immunology in the
                                department of medicine at NYU School of Medicine in New York City.
                                "As that happens, there is an inflammatory reaction by the immune system."

                        <p>
                            The inflammatory response generated by your besieged immune system
                                also can cause you to feel tired and lethargic. Fatigue can be 
                                both an early and later sign of HIV.<br><br>

                            Ron, 54, a public relations executive in the Midwest, started to 
                                worry about his health when he suddenly got winded just walking.
                                "Everything I did, I got out of breath," he says. "Before that 
                                I had been walking three miles a day."<br><br>

                            Ron had tested HIV positive 25 years before feeling so tired; fatigue
                                during acute, or newly contracted, HIV might not be so obvious.

                        <p>
                            As with other symptoms, sore throat and headache can often be
                                recognized as ARS only in context, Dr. Horberg says.<br><br>

                            If you've engaged recently in high-risk behavior, an HIV test is
                                a good idea. Get tested for your own sake and for others: HIV is
                                most infectious in the earliest stage.<br><br>

                            Keep in mind that the body hasn't produced antibodies to HIV yet 
                                so an antibody test may not pick it up. (It can take a few weeks 
                                to a few monthsfor HIV antibodies to show in a blood test). Investigate
                                other test options such as one that detects viral RNA, typically 
                                within nine days of infection.

                        <p>
                            Skin rashes can occur early or late in the course of HIV/AIDS.<br>
                            <br>
                            For Ron, this was another sign that he might not have run-of-the-mill
                                allergies or a cold.<br>
                                <br>
                            "They were like boils, with some itchy pink areas on my arms," Ron says.
                                The rashes can also appear on the trunk of the body. "If [the rashes] 
                                aren't easily explained or easily treated, you should think about having
                                an HIV test," Dr. Horberg says.

                        <p>
                            Once called "AIDS wasting," weight loss is a sign of more advanced illness
                                and could be due in part to severe diarrhea.<br>
                                <br>
                           "If you're already losing weight, that means the immune system is usually 
                                fairly depleted," Dr. Malvestutto says. "This is the patient who has lost
                                a lot of weight even if they continue to eat as much as possible. This is
                                late presentation. We still see a lot of these." It has become less common,
                                however, thanks to antiretroviral therapy.<br>
                                <br>
                            A person is considered to have wasting syndrome if they lose 10% or more of
                            their body weight and have had diarrhea or weakness and fever for more than
                            30 days, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

                        <p>
                            A dry cough was the first sign Ron had that something was wrong. He at first
                            dismissed it as bad allergies.
                            <br><br>
                            But it went on for a year and a half—and kept getting worse. Benadryl, 
                            antibiotics, and inhalers didn't fix the problem. Neither did allergists.
                            <br><br>
                            This symptom—an "insidious cough that could be going on for weeks that 
                            doesn't seem to resolve," Dr. Malvestutto says—is typical in very ill 
                            HIV patients.
