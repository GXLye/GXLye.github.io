                    <h1>Major Mistakes Healthy People Make</h1>

                    <div class="section-1">
                        <p>You pick healthy food, work out (when you can), and watch your 
                            waistline. That means you're healthy right? Not so fast—many 
                            people who are in tip-top shape (for now) have habits or beliefs 
                            that can put them at risk for illness or injury down the road.</p>
                        <p>Read on to learn about these common mistakes, and how you can 
                            avoid them.</p><br>
                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/1/mistake1organic.jpg" alt="mistake1"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link">You always buy organic</h3>

                        <p>Buying organic is wise for certain foods, such as beef or 
                            strawberries, but it doesn't make much difference for others,
                            like avocados or eggs.<br>
                        <br>
                        And don't assume that all organic foods are healthier than non-organic
                        options, or that organic equals healthy. Organic choices are usually 
                        pricier, for one thing. And organic high-calorie, high-fat granola 
                        bars and sugary cereals are just as bad for you as the non-organic 
                        version.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/1/mistake2socialize.jpg" alt="mistake2"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link2">You don't socialize enough</h3>

                        <p>While you may feel virtuous on your long solo runs, don't forget 
                            to check in with your pals once in a while. Studies suggest that
                            social networks are good for your health too.<br>
                        <br>
                        Try to schedule regular meet-ups with friends, whether it's a book 
                        club or poker—it doesn't matter. (No need to make it exercise-based,
                        although that's nice too.)<br>
                        <br>
                        Just connecting with other people, and maintaining those social 
                        networks as you age, is good for your health.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/1/mistake3sleep.jpg" alt="mistake3"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link3">You skimp on sleep</h3>

                        <p>Think it's a good idea to get up at 5 a.m. and hit the gym? Not 
                            if you should be sleeping instead, says Gary Rogg, MD, a primary
                            care physician and assistant professor at Montefiore Medical Center
                            in the Bronx, N.Y. Studies have consistently shown that people 
                            need at least seven hours of sleep a night for optimal health,
                            and short sleep has been associated with a host of health problems,
                            including high blood pressure, depression, diabetes, and a reduced 
                            immune response to vaccines.</p><br>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/1/mistake4supplement.jpg" alt="mistake4"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link4">You lack supplement savvy</h3>

                        <p>More is not better when it comes to vitamins and supplements, and
                            too much of a good thing can actually be harmful.<br>
                        <br>
                        In 2011, an analysis of data on nearly 40,000 women found that those
                        who took dietary supplements—especially iron—were actually at slightly
                        higher risk of dying, although the investigators weren't sure why. 
                        "There's no really long-term studies that show unequivocal benefits 
                        of taking vitamin and mineral supplements," says Dr. Rogg. "If you're
                        going to take supplements, take them in moderation, and stick to the 
                        recommended daily doses."</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/1/mistake5test.jpg" alt="mistake5"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link5">You get unnecessary medical tests</h3>

                        <p>As with vitamins and minerals, more does not always mean better when
                            it comes to medical tests. Especially tests marketed directly to
                            consumers, like the cardiac calcium-scoring test. While this test—a
                            CT scan that identifies calcium deposits in the heart arteries—is 
                            useful for a select group of at-risk people, it isn't for everyone,
                            says Dr. Rogg. It also exposes you to a whopping amount of radiation
                            —the equivalent of 25 to 50 chest X-rays.<br>
                        <br>
                        Several US medical specialty groups have launched an initiative, Choosing 
                        Wisely, to draw attention to overuse of 45 medical tests, and encourage
                        physicians to avoid tests and procedures of questionable benefit.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/1/mistake6anitbiotics.jpg" alt="mistake6"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link6">You beg for antibiotics</h3>

                        <p>Many people ask their doctor for a prescription for antibiotics or
                            antivirals for symptoms that probably would resolve on their own,
                            or just because they fear getting sick.<br>
                        <br>
                        And some doctors may oblige. But these drugs also carry risks, from 
                        contributing to the huge problem of drug resistance to killing off 
                        the good bacteria in your body. Let your doctor decide if your symptoms
                        warrant medication, and skip the high-pressure tactics</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/1/mistake7germaphobe.jpg" alt="mistake7"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link7">You're a germaphobe</h3>

                        <p>We all know people who never leave the house without their hand 
                            sanitizer—you may even be that person. And yes, you shouldwash 
                            your hands with soap and water to kill germs that can make you sick.<br>
                        <br>
                        But evidence also suggests that some germ exposure could steer the 
                        immune system away from allergies, and that an overly sterile environment
                        might be bad. (It's called the hygiene hypothesis.) Good bacteria are 
                        also key for staying healthy, particularly for theskin, digestive tract,
                        and vagina. So "fear of germs" does not equal "good health."</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/1/mistake8alternate.jpg" alt="mistake8"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link8">You over or underdo alternative remedies</h3>

                        <p>Once upon a time, it was hard to get the medical establishment to 
                            recognize that acupuncture, herbal remedies, or biofeedback could
                            sometimes heal people as well as big-name drugs.<br>
                        <br>
                        Now we know that if you dismiss acupuncture as “quackery,” you may 
                        be missing out on your best therapy yet. At the same time, if you over-rely
                        on alternative medicine—opting for a herbal remedies instead of chemotherapy, 
                        for instance—you may also be missing out on the best cure yet.<br>
                        <br>
                        Try to keep an open mind and consult the experts to make informed choices.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/1/mistake9delay.jpg" alt="mistake9"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link9">You delay medical care</h3>

                        <p>You’re healthy, so that crushing chest pain has to be heartburn, right?
                            Or weakness and confusion can't be a stroke, right? Wrong. All too
                            often, people stall or explain away serious symptoms, when in fact,
                            rapid treatment can help prevent permanent heart or brain damage.<br>
                        <br>
                        Doctors say "time is tissue," meaning the faster you get treatment for 
                        a stroke or heart attack the less heart or brain tissue you lose. So don't
                        delay if you have stroke or heart attack symptoms.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/1/mistake10exercise.jpg" alt="mistake10"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link10">You use exercise alone to shed pounds</h3>

                        <p>Regular exercise is crucial for health and maintaining a healthy 
                            weight, but it won't help you lose weight unless you cut down your
                            calorie intake.<br>
                        <br>
                        "Patients exercise themselves until they're blue in the face, they're 
                        frustrated, they're sort of at a loss as to why they haven't had success,"
                        says Shantanu Nundy, MD, a primary care physician at the University of
                        Chicago. But the truth is that exercise—maybe because it whets the appetite,
                        maybe because we decide it's OK to reward ourselves with a treat after that
                        workout, maybe both—often makes people eat more, which means you'll make up
                        for the calories you just burned, and then some.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/1/mistake11sodium.jpg" alt="mistake11"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link11">You ignore sodium</h3>

                        <p>You watch your calories. You avoid meals dripping with saturated fat.
                            But sodium? All too often that's the ingredient that gets ignored when
                            weighing healthy options.<br>
                        <br>
                        High sodium intake has been firmly tied to an increased risk of high 
                        blood pressure, and the average American eats well over the recommended
                        amount. Most of the excess sodium we consume comes from packaged and 
                        prepared foods, from spaghetti sauce to frozen dinners. Always check 
                        nutrition labels for sodium content; the Institute of Medicine recommends
                        people limit their intake to below 2,300 milligrams per day, and 1,500 mg
                        for people 51 and older, African Americans, and anyone with high blood
                        pressure or diabetes.</p>

                        <p>Artificially sweetened beverages may free of calories, but it doesn't
                            mean they're all that great for your health.<br>
                        <br>
                        A couple of studies released at the 2011 American Diabetes Association's
                        annual meeting suggest just the opposite. One found that older people who
                        drank lots of diet soda saw their waistlines expand five times more over 
                        a decade than their peers who didn't drink diet soda at all, while another 
                        showed that mice fed the artificial sweetener aspartame had higher blood-sugar
                        levels.</p>

                        <p>Dehydration is bad. So more water is good, right?<br>
                        <br>
                        The human body contains from 55% to 78% water, depending on body size. To 
                        function properly, the body requires between one and seven liters of water
                        per day to avoid dehydration; the precise amount depends on the level of 
                        activity, temperature, humidity, and other factors.<br>
                        <br>
                        That's true, to a point. But particularly if you're running your first 
                        marathon or some other physically taxing, long event it's important to 
                        avoid drinking too much water, which could lead towater intoxication 
                        (also known as hyponatremia).</p>

                        <h3 id="link14">You lie to your doctor</h3>

                        <p>Many of us don't tell our doc everything—say, we smoke cigarettes
                            or drink more than we should. Or we may take that prescription with
                            no intention of ever filling it. Harvard Medical School researchers 
                            found that more than one in five first-time prescriptions never got
                            filled (this was especially true for chronic conditions such as high
                            cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes).<br>
                        <br>
                        But you're better off being straight with your doctor, who can help you
                        find ways to kick the habit or find a treatment you'll actually take (or
                        be able to afford). If you don't feel you can be fully honest with your 
                        doctor, says Dr. Nundy, you should look for a new one.</p>

                        <h3 id="link15">You think you know more than your doctor</h3>

                        <p>With the Internet at our fingertips, we all feel smarter than we did 
                            in the past. And well-moderated online forums can be a great resource
                            for helping people with certain health concerns get support and stay
                            informed.  But they are no substitute for a doctor’s advice.<br>
                        <br>
                        “I think a common mistake is to sort of put more faith in those resources
                        than health care professionals,” says Dr. Nundy, the author of Stay Healthy 
                        at Every Age:<i> What Your Doctor Wants You to Know.</i></p>

                        <h3 id="link16">You think healthy packaging equals healthy food</h3>

                        <p>Food or cosmetics products that boast of being all natural may sound
                            appealing and wholesome, but in fact, the US Food and Drug Administration 
                            has a pretty loose definition of just what that word means.<br>
                        <br>
                        The FDA is OK with any product claiming to be natural, as long as it doesn't
                        contain added color, artificial flavor, or synthetic substances.<br>
                        <br>
                        Low fat is another tricky claim. The FDA does have clear guidelines on
                        when a product can claim to be low- or reduced-fat, but these products
                        may still be high in sugar, sodium, or calories—or all of the above.</p>

                        <h3 id="link17">You exercise too much</h3>

                        <p>Pushing yourself is usually a good thing when it comes to physical 
                            activity. But your body needs rest, too, especially after an extra-hard
                            workout. Signs that you are working out too hard can be mental and
                            physical, and include fatigue, difficulty sleeping, decreased immunity,
                            muscle soreness, and injury. To keep your workout fresh—and avoid
                            overuse injuries—it's a good idea to vary your routine, and give yourself
                            a day off now and then. "Sometimes, just sitting back and relaxing is
                            better for your body than going to the gym for that hour," says Dr. Rogg.</p>

                         <h3 id="link18">You still don't eat your fruits and veggies</h3>

                        <p>By now, pretty much everyone knows they should be eating at least five
                            servings of fruit and vegetables per day. Eating plenty of produce 
                            helps reduce your risk of heart disease and several types of cancer,
                            and can help you manage your weight too. But a state-by-state survey
                            by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2009,
                            just one-third of adults reported eating at least two servings of fruit
                            a day, and only about one-quarter ate three or more servings of veggies daily.</p><br>

                         <h3 id="link19">You obsess over the details</h3>

                        <p>Health shouldn't be seen as something to strive for, but as a way of life,
                            Dr. Rogg says. "When you focus on keeping healthy as an endpoint, as 
                            opposed to a healthy lifestyle, you may tend to sort of miss the whole
                            picture."<br>
                        <br>
                        Too often, Dr. Rogg says, people who want to be healthy focus on avoiding 
                        "bad" foods and obsess about numbers, like their body mass index. "The focus
                        that people have to make is on being happy and on things that will make 
                        them happy, and enjoy themselves."</p>

                        <p>Grown ups need shots, too, but many of us don't get them—raising our 
                            risk of contracting a host of unpleasant, deadly—and preventable—illnesses,
                            from the flu to cervical cancer to shingles. Just one in five at-risk 
                            adults under 65 received the pneumococcal vaccine, for example.<br>
                        <br>
                        Recommendations for adult vaccine coverage vary based on age, health, where
                        you travel and what you're exposed to, but the Centers for Disease Control 
                        and Prevention recommends an annual flu shot for everyone, and a 
                        diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis booster every 10 years for adults. Check out 
                        the full list of recommended vaccines for adults.</p>
