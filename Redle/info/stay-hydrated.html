                        <p>Your body depends on water for survival. Did you know that water makes up
                            more than half of your body weight? Every cell, tissue and organ in your 
                            body needs water to function correctly. For example, your body uses water
                            to maintain its temperature, remove waste and lubricate joints. Water is 
                            essential for good health.</p>

                        <p>Below are a list of foods that can keep you hydrated at all times:</p><br>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/water.jpg" alt="Water"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link">Water</h3>

                        <p>According to the old rule of thumb, you're supposed to drink eight glasses 
                            of water per day (and some experts recommend even more). That can seem like 
                            a daunting task on some days, but here's the catch: You don't have to drink
                            all that water.<br>
                        <br>
                        Roughly 20% of our daily H2O intake comes from solid foods, especially fruits 
                        and vegetables.It's still important to drink plenty of water—especially in the
                        summertime—but you can also quench your thirst with these 15 hugely hydrating 
                        foods, all of which are at least 90% water by weight.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/cucumber.jpg" alt="Cucumber"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link2">Cucumber</h3>

                        <p>This summer veggie—which has the highest water content of any solid food—is
                            perfect in salads, or sliced up and served with some hummus, says Keri Gans,
                            RD, author of The Small Change Diet: 10 Steps to a Thinner and Healthier You 
                            and a consultant to Mindbloom, a technology company that makes life-improvement
                            apps. Want to pump up cucumber's hydrating power even more? Try blending it 
                            with nonfat yogurt, mint, and ice cubes to make cucumber soup. "Soup is always
                            hydrating, but you may not want to eat something hot in the summertime,"<br>
                        <br>
                        Gans says. "Chilled cucumber soup, on the other hand, is so refreshing and 
                        delicious any time of year."</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/lettuce.jpg" alt="Lettuce"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link3">Iceberg Lettuce</h3>

                        <p>Iceberg lettuce tends to get a bad rap, nutrition-wise. Health experts often
                            recommend shunning it in favor of darker greens like spinach or romaine lettuce,
                            which contain higher amounts of fiber and nutrients such as folate and vitamin
                            K. It's a different story when it comes to water content, though: Crispy iceberg
                            has the highest of any lettuce, followed by butterhead, green leaf, and romaine 
                            varieties. So when the temperature rises, pile iceberg onto sandwiches or use 
                            it as a bed for a healthy chicken salad. Even better: Ditch the tortillas and 
                            hamburger buns and use iceberg leaves as a wrap for tacos and burgers.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/celery.jpg" alt="Celery"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link4">Celery</h3>

                        <p>That urban legend about celery having negative calories isn't quite true, but 
                            it's pretty close. Like all foods that are high in water, celery has very few
                            calories—just 6 calories per stalk. And its one-two punch of fiber and water
                            helps to fill you up and curb your appetite. This lightweight veggie isn't short
                            on nutrition, however. Celery contains folate and vitamins A, C, and K. And 
                            thanks in part to its high water content, celery neutralizes stomach acid and
                            is often recommended as a natural remedy for heartburn and acid reflux.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/radishes.jpg" alt="Radishes"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link5">Radishes</h3>

                        <p>These refreshing root vegetables should be a fixture in your spring and summer 
                            salads. They provide a burst of spicy-sweet flavor—and color!—in a small package, 
                            and more importantly they're filled with antioxidants such as catechin (also found
                            in green tea). A crunchy texture also makes radishes a perfect addition to healthy
                            summer coleslaw—no mayo required. Slice them up with shredded cabbage and carrots,
                            sliced snow peas, and chopped hazelnuts and parsley, and toss with poppy seeds,
                            lemon juice, olive oil, salt, and pepper.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/tomatoes.jpg" alt="Tomatoes"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link6">Tomatoes</h3>

                        <p>Sliced and diced tomatoes will always be a mainstay of salads, sauces, and sandwiches,
                            but don't forget about sweet cherry and grape varieties, which make an excellent
                            hydrating snack, Gans says. "They're great to just pop in your mouth, maybe with 
                            some nuts or some low-sodium cheese," she says. "You get this great explosion of 
                            flavor when you bite into them."<br>
                        <br>
                        Having friends over? Skewer grape tomatoes, basil leaves, and small chunks of mozzarella 
                        on toothpicks for a quick and easy appetizer.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/green_peppers.jpg" alt="Green peppers"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link7">Green peppers</h3>

                        <p>Bell peppers of all shades have a high water content, but green peppers lead the pack, 
                            just edging out the red and yellow varieties (which are about 92% water). And contrary
                            to popular belief, green peppers contain just as many antioxidants as their slightly
                            sweeter siblings. Peppers are a great pre-dinner or late-night snack, Gans says. "We
                            tell people to munch on veggies when they have a craving, but a lot of people get 
                            bored of carrots and celery pretty quickly," she says. "Peppers are great to slice 
                            up when you get home from work, while you're making or waiting for dinner."</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/cauliflower.jpg" alt="Cauliflower"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link8">Cauliflower</h3>

                        <p>Don't let cauliflower's pale complexion fool you: In addition to having lots of water,
                            these unassuming florets are packed with vitamins and phytonutrients that have been 
                            shown to help lower cholesterol and fight cancer, including breast cancer. (A 2012study
                            of breast cancer patients by Vanderbilt University researchers found that eating 
                            cruciferous veggies like cauliflower was associated with a lower risk of dying from
                            the disease or seeing a recurrence.)<br>
                        <br>
                        "Break them up and add them to a salad for a satisfying crunch," Gans suggests. "You can
                        even skip the croutons!"</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/watermelon.jpg" alt="Watermelon"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link9">Watermelon</h3>

                        <p>It's fairly obvious that watermelon is full of, well, water, but this juicy melon is 
                            also among the richest sources of lycopene, a cancer-fighting antioxidant found in red
                            fruits and vegetables. In fact, watermelon contains more lycopene than raw tomatoes—about 
                            12 milligrams per wedge, versus 3 milligrams per medium-sized tomato. Although this
                            melon is plenty hydrating on its own, Gans loves to mix it with water in the summertime.<br>
                        <br>
                        "Keep a water pitcher in the fridge with watermelon cubes in the bottom," she says. "It's 
                        really refreshing, and great incentive to drink more water overall."</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/spinach.jpg" alt="Spinach"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link10">Spinach</h3>

                        <p>Iceberg lettuce may have a higher water content, but spinach is usually a better bet 
                            overall. Piling raw spinach leaves on your sandwich or salad provides nearly as much
                            built-in hydration, with an added nutritional punch. Spinach is rich in lutein, potassium,
                            fiber, and brain-boosting folate, and just one cup of raw leaves contains 15% of your
                            daily intake of vitamin E—an important antioxidant for fighting off the damaging 
                            molecules known as free radicals.</p><br>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/star_fruit.jpg" alt="Star fruit"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link11">Star fruit</h3>

                        <p>This tropical fruit, also known ascarambola, comes in sweet and tart varieties and
                            has a juicy texture similar to pineapple. Its eye-catching shape looks great in a 
                            fruit salad or as an edible garnish on the rim of a summer cocktail, and as an added
                            bonus it's rich in antioxidants, especially epicatechin—a heart-healthy compound 
                            also found in red wine, dark chocolate, and green tea. One note of caution: People
                            with kidney problems should avoid star fruit because of its high levels of oxalic acid.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/strawberries.jpg" alt="Strawberries"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link12">Strawberries</h3>

                        <p>All berries are good foods for hydration, but juicy red strawberries are easily the
                            best of the bunch. Raspberries and blueberries both hover around 85% water, while 
                            blackberries are only slightly better at 88.2%. "I love strawberries blended in a 
                            smoothie or mixed with plain nonfat yogurt—another hydrating food," Gans says. 
                            Strawberries add natural sweetness to the yogurt, she adds, and the combo of 
                            carbohydrates, fiber, and protein make a great post-workout recovery snack.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/broccoli.jpg" alt="Broccoli"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link13">Broccoli</h3>

                        <p>Like its cousin cauliflower, raw broccoli adds a satisfying crunch to a salad. But 
                            its nutritional profile—lots of fiber, potassium, vitamin A, and vitamin C—is
                            slightly more impressive. What's more, broccoli is the only cruciferous vegetable
                            (a category that contains cabbageand kale, in addition to cauliflower) with a
                            significant amount of sulforaphane, a potent compound that boosts the body's 
                            protective enzymes and flushes out cancer-causing chemicals.</p>

                        <figure class="sideline"><img src="images/2/grapefruit.jpg" alt="Grapefruit"></figure>

                        <h3 id="link14">Grapefruit</h3>

                        <p>This juicy, tangy citrus fruit can help lower cholesterol and shrink your waistline,
                            research suggests. In one study, people who ate onegrapefruit a day lowered their
                            bad (LDL) cholesterol by 15.5% and their triglycerides by 27%. In another, eating
                            half a grapefruit—roughly 40 calories—before each meal helped dieters lose about
                            three and a half pounds over 12 weeks. Researchers say that compounds in the fruit
                            help fuel fat burn and stabilize blood sugar, therefore helping to reduce cravings.</p>

                        <p>A carrot's a carrot, right? Not when it comes to water content. As it turns out, 
                            the baby-sized carrots that have become a staple in supermarkets and lunchboxes 
                            contain more water than full-size carrots (which are merely 88.3% water). The 
                            ready-to-eat convenience factor is hard to top, as well. Snack on them right out
                            of the bag, dip them in hummus or guacamole, or—for a bit of added crunch and
                            bright orange color—chop them up and add them to salads or salsas.</p>

                        <p>This succulent melon provides a big nutritional payoff for very few calories. One
                            six-ounce serving—about one-quarter of a melon—contains just 50 calories but 
                            delivers a full 100% of your recommended daily intake of vitamins A and C. "I love
                            cantaloupe as a dessert," Gans says. "If you've got a sweet tooth, it will definitely 
                            satisfy." Tired of plain old raw fruit? Blend cantaloupe with yogurt and freeze 
                            it into sherbet, or puree it with orange juice and mint to make arefreshing soup.</p>
